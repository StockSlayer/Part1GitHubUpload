Description: Who, What, Where, How, Why
Who: The user of the software is any baseball nerd that enjoys the statistical/ analytical side of the game. 
What: Not 100% sure yet. I think it will evolve into roster building software to which a user can put together a list or set of their favorite players and compare their statistics against one another. 
Where & When: Anytime if you were on a fantasy baseball league or even if you were a part of an analytics team for a major league club and working in the analytical department this could be used to help make decisions on how you want to build you team. Or just a stat head looking to find out some information on a player and compare him to others ither during the session to see how the player is progressing or during the off season during free agency and can look at a player’s stats and see how much a team is willing to spend on that player. 
How: Right now, you have a roster that is preset, and you decided on whether you want thoughts players to be sorted if there a pitcher by there ERA(earned run average) or if a hitter you sort the player on their AVG(batting average). Though in the future I hope to have a software that will be able to add a set or list of players and calculate all different types of statistics finding out how the better players are. 
Why: Because it is a simple free  software that allows a person who’s not in an MLB club to get a players statistics on an application that is user friendly and on multiple devises. Also, not bombarded with adds that destroy the experience of looking up stats.
